# SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, embedded database that can easily handle multiple gigabytes of data. It is one of the world’s most popular embedded database systems. It is convenient to share data stored in an SQLite database --- just one cross-platform file which doesn’t need to be parsed explicitly (unlike CSV files, which have to be loaded and parsed). On the other hand, SQLite supports simple but powerful Full Text Search (FTS) for fast text-based querying, which allows users to perform full-text searches on documents similar to how search engines search webpages.

This project utilizes SQLite to perform queries, including text-based ones, on the crawled LEGO data set from Rebrickable.
